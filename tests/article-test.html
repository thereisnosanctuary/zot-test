            <p>The French warship <em>Camille</em> arrived in Auckland harbor yesterday morning, creating quite a stir among the local population. The vessel, under the command of Captain Henri Dubois, represents one of the finest examples of modern naval engineering to grace our waters.</p>
            
            <p>The <em>Camille</em>, a corvette of the French Imperial Navy, carries a complement of 180 officers and men. Her arrival was announced by the firing of seven guns, to which the battery at Point Britomart responded with appropriate courtesy.</p>
            
            <p>Captain Dubois paid his respects to His Excellency Sir George Grey this morning, and it is understood that the vessel will remain in port for approximately one week to take on provisions and allow the crew some well-deserved shore leave.</p>
            
            <p>The ship has attracted considerable attention from our citizens, many of whom gathered at the wharf to witness her impressive lines and formidable armament. The <em>Camille</em> represents the latest in French naval design, with her steam-assisted propulsion and modern rifled guns.</p>
            
            <p>During her stay, it is expected that Captain Dubois and his officers will participate in various social functions organized by Auckland's French community and colonial officials.</p>
